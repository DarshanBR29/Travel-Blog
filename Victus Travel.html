                    <p class="time">Lucifer Morningstar • July 2, 2023</p>
                    <p class="post-summary">Coorg it was for a long weekend. It's hard to believe that i have never been to Coorg having lived in the south all my life. We decided to try the homestay option and this landed us in Polaycad. Polaycad is a lovely old colonial bungalow adjoining the coffee estate and belongs to Mrs and Mr Cariappa, a lovely couple who hosted for 3 whole days. As Robin Cariappa explained to us on the tour of estate that "polay" in Coorgi language means river and "cad" means forest as is in Tamil also. The language that the coorgis speak is a hotch potch of various languages and does not really have a script of its own (well i didnt know that before!!!!!)

                      I lazed and slept and ate for the whole three days. Mallige (Not sure if I got taht right) Cariappa served us really delicious coorg dishes. What with anish starving for Pork dishes!!!! She actually made a lot of vegetarian dishes ...this is special 'coz coorg is famous for meat dishes particularly pork.</p>

                    <p class="time">Chole Decker • June 30, 2023</p>
                    <p class="post-summary">Most Indian cities are bustling- always busy. Perhaps Mysore is the only city that takes its sweet time to function. If you want to have a “Chiang Mai” kind of atmosphere (except for vegan cafes) in one of the cleanest cities in India, Mysore must be on your list.

                      It is one of the most famous tourist destinations among foreign and domestic tourists. But maybe because of people’s laid-back nature and pride in preserving their heritage, the city hasn’t lost its authentic charm. You can make it as expensive as possible by staying in palace hotels and dining in Maharaja style to experience the grandeur. Or have a super budget-friendly holiday by staying in hostels(Yes, hostel culture is pretty famous here).
                      
                      Travel to Mysore for some village charm
                      Suppose you love driving around the place by yourself and haven’t been able to do it in India because of our traffic issues; Mysore is the best place to go cycling or driving. To sum it up – the city is super clean, laid back, good for self-drive, has good food, history and heritage and is surrounded by mountains.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-heading">Ooty</h2>
                    <p class="time">Mazekein • June 28, 2023</p>
                    <p class="post-summary">In my utter confusion of which hill station to visit, Neel suggested we take a bus to Ooty, another five and a half hour of journey. So we started, sitting in the cabin of the driver, having a clear view of the front, not compromising any side of the road. Just after 15 mins of the start of our journey, we came across the Chamundi hills and a number of lakes above which we could point out the cormorants and the ibis. The weather was pleasant with the sun and the clouds playing hide-and-seek and also one or two bouts of drizzles. The Mysore-Ooty highway turns adventurous once it crosses Gundulpet. After this, starts the Bandipur Tiger Reserve maintained by the state of Karnataka which continues as the Mudhumalai Tiger Reserve in Tamil Nadu. One can easily see herd of deer, peafowls and wildboars on the wayside. One may also come across the tuskers and various colourful birds if cautious. And if one is lucky enough, the big cat may also be sighted who keeps an eye on the busy highway from the shrubs!!!</p>

                    <p class="time">Amendial • June 26, 2023</p>
                    <p class="post-summary">I booked a walking tour through Tripadvisor yesterday, with a female guide, Faridausi and Glyn booked an Uber to meet her in town. She was almost 20 minutes late, but it seems in Uganda, that’s standard and not worth an apology.

                      The first stop was a statue of Edward Mutesa, the first president of Uganda, (after independence from the UK in 1962). He was also the King and pushed out of power by Milton Obote and sent into exile, aided by Idi Amin. And then Obote was ousted by Idi Amin, who made himself popular by returning the body of Mutesa, so he could be buried in Uganda.
                      
                      Nearby stood a statue celebrating Uganda’s independence, a public place with a few homeless scattered around. A very old sign displayed photographs from 1962. </p>

                    <p class="time">Dan Esponaza • June 20, 2023</p>
                    <p class="post-summary">We just arrived in Venice, but I want to catch up on our hike in the Dolomites.

                      From Salzburg we took the train to Bolzano, the main town of the Alto Adige (if you're Italian) or Sudtirol (if you're Austrian). There's still a very strong German-speaking presence here, even though the area was grabbed by Italy after the First World War.
                      
                      On Monday we took a bus from Bolzano to Selva, a small town in the beautiful Val Gardena, and started our hike. At first it was a pleasant stroll up the gently climbing valley, enclosed on both sides by towering, jagged peaks. Before long the terrain became much steeper and we climbed up on stony trails to the first rifugio, Puez. It sits in a high meadow, just above the cliff over the valley. It's on a well-travelled route called the Alta Via 2, and so is much bigger and busier than the huts in Austria. We had a 4-course dinner, sitting at a table with a friendly Swedish couple and a father and son from Koeln. Our beds were in a dorm, but we were so tired from the exertions of the day that we slept well.</p>

                    <p class="post-summary">This blog - the second part of our trip to the Forest of Dean and the Welsh borders - has been a wile in the creative process. Sometimes, the words just flow. Other times, they don't. On this occasion, I can blame neither and life has just quite simply got in the way. There is no high powered career to bother about anymore, but getting the best out of the NHS is in effect a job in its own right. Life is very much dominated by the latter at the moment and even this trip was a last minute plan, squeezed in between the various appointments and blood tests that the Other Half now has in her permanent calendar. The majority spend a significant portion of their lives avoiding the institution and it seems such a shame, that when you come to a point in your life that you require their services, the system has become a political football. Appointments. Cancelled appointments. Industrial action. Right hand and left hand seemingly unable to communicate.

                    <h2 class="post-heading">Our last day in Chile!</h2>
                    <p class="time">Charollet Richards • June 10, 2018</p>
                    <p class="post-summary">Have you ever fallen in love with a country so much that you wished you could live there forever? Believe me or not, that’s what I felt about Chile after an amazing 10 days journey in this beautiful country. We travelled from top to bottom in Chile, and I enjoyed every moment of it. I know this sounds a bit impractical, but I felt that I blended so well with the lifestyle as if I had been living there so many years. Despite my language barrier, I enjoyed company of the common people, places like Punta Arenas and San Pedro made me feel home, I could watch the beauty of Torres del Paine for eternity. Somehow, I found a mental bond with the country. Spending noontime in a food court in Santiago Mall or asking subway train fare to a ticket agent using Google Translate in my smart phone felt so normal at a time. It never occurred to me that I am just a visitor in Chile. Does it sound real? Well, you all know I am a crazy nomad. </p>
